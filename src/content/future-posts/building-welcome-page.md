G'day Internet,

I am quite proud of the home page for this website.

It is heavily inspired by my now outdated [github landing page](https://noejon.github.io/)

## Pre article

Maybe this is also a multipart article. Header issue is one. Intersection observer another? And then This is Jon?

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/isIntersecting>

The header. Removing the small to keep it fixed

The TIL about sticky and the weird 1 pixel (create another post that you can link to an release it prior to this)

Why a spacer div and not better margin padding: Because the space is actually filled with the message box. And I use the top of the div to bind the message
Built it mobile first, with a big font for accessibility, came with a challenges. It needs more space for the message box.

That's All Folks!

Jon
