# Making my homepage AAA accessible

Used Contrast checker a lot.

Lots of my easter eggs could not be used but that is OK.

Used Wave and Axe tools to check.

Blink-182:

Added aria description, as the dev is similar to an image, needed to purvey that information to the user.

It's probably not all that accessible still!
