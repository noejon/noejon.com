## Interviewer best practices

### Dos

Do leave room for questions. An interview should ideally be both ways. You are making sure the interviewee is fit for the position, but the interviewee should walk away from the interview process with a pretty clear idea of where is going to land if the accepts the job offer.

Do be honest when you answer questions. There is nothing worse than promoting a lie to get someone to sign. They will realise you were lying in the first few days and leave the company. I once unwillingly lied and hired someone as a technical lead, while I was supposed to transition to an official engineering manager position that I was already doing, leading 2 teams. That transition was cancelled a week after hiring the tech lead. That tech lead was given 4 people to manage, when he clearly told us that he did not want to manage people. And ended up leaving the company 3 weeks later.

Do put the candidate at ease. As I mentioned above this is a both way process, you interview them as much as they interview you. So when you say you can use google, mean it. And show it. If it is a pair programming session actually pair, help them when they struggle, build some momentum so that they forget they are in an interview.

Do respect the candidate. They offer you their time, to go through your interview process. Give them feedback and give them feedback early. There is nothing worse than doing an interview and waiting for a feedback. I am usually trying to make a decision on the same day.

Do have a process that does not drag over many weeks/months.

### Don'ts

Don't advertise an interview as a pairing session when it is just a disguised coding interview.

Don't say your take home test takes two hours when it needs a weekend to complete. Candidates want to show their best side and will spend the time to do so. Even if you tell them to do it in two hours, they'll spend more time. Cater for this and if you say something takes two hours it's because your team all took just one hour to complete it.

Don't do it on a code sandbox or an environment the interviewee is not used to. But Jon, they will have intellisense! Yeah, they will when they work also. One caveat here, I would still ask anyone to turn off their AI helpers during a live coding session. AI helpers write the code for you, sometimes substantial amount of it, so it becomes difficult for me to assess if the person knows how to write proper code without an AI helper.

Don't throw curve balls. I know that some companies do this. I understand that this helps figuring out how people react when they are under pressure. This does not take into account the current pressure they are on. As an interviewer the current pressure is something that you need to gauge before throwing a curve ball.

<!-- Maybe I am biased because I put pressure on myself during interviews. To a point where my brain just forgets the most simple things. I have a few legendary examples of this:

- I once forgot how to use javascript arrays. I was just blocked there and unable to do anything. Arrays that I literally use every day
- I once forgot about `event.target.value` which is also something that I use often.
- I once forgot even the name of the native javascript `fetch` function. -->

From there it generally spirals into nothingness and all I think about is that I want the interview to end to save me from this embarrassment.

Don't ask candidates to work on an actual production issue. Whatever the type of interview you are doing.

Don't ghost candidates after they interviewed with you. If you realise that a mistake happened in the process and you ghosted them as a result, send an apology.

That's all folks!

Jon
