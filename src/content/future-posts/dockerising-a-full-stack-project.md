G'day Internet,

Today we'll work together to setup a full stack application fully running in [docker](https://www.docker.com)

It all starts with installing docker if you have not done that yet.

## Installing docker

Go get the latest version of the [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) app and install it.

This will install the desktop application as well as the Docker CLI and Docker Compose.

We won't deploy our application anywhere in the cloud, this tutorial is mostly to run the full project locally.

Here is a github repo if you want to follow along....

## What we're going to build

We are going to build a simple CRUD application for quotes. For this we'll have three components, a preact frontend, a backend using nest.js and prisma and a postgres database.

Let's start with react

## Frontend

## Backend
