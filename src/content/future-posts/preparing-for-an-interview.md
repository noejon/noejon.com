First let's go on a bit of a tangent and talk about interview preparation and the mistake I made during the preparation for this one.

## The importance of good preparation for me

I am very insecure in interviews. I once failed the simplest code pairing interview because I had a blank on how JavaScript arrays works. Those same arrays I use on a daily basis... That is when I decided this can't happen anymore and set up a process to prepare for interview.

Here is a summary of my preparation process. I will add a link here later, as this topic deserves it's own post.

The thing that worked for me for the first 7 interviews is good preparation. First and foremost, try to get as much information as possible from the talent acquisition person you are talking. Most often than not they want you to succeed and will help you prepare well. Once you have that information prepare, prepare, prepare. I have tones of questions and answer to those questions somewhere in my drive. Have examples ready for those situations. And the night before an interview, I actually go to bed early. It does help cement what I just reviewed and gives me that confidence. The last thing I do is flex my (hidden) muscles, Cristiano Ronaldo style, in a winner pose a few minutes before the interview (even better if there is a mirror in front of me). Taking that stress in and make it positive stress.

My mistake here was to accept the last interview, with the CPO, on the same day. Got a call Monday morning and the interview was set up on the Monday evening. That gave me no time for my preparation process. And that showed during the interview, I was not as confident as I was in the previous interviews and not-knowing-how-javascript-arrays-work me was back for the most important interview of the process.
