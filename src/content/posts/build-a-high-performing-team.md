G'day Internet

In the past I interviewed for a role of Tech Lead Manager at [Honey Insurance](https://www.linkedin.com/company/honey-insurance/).

I had passed the first 6 interviews (screening, Intro with the VP of engineering, take home test, behavioural/culture fit with enginering managers, system design, behavioural/culture fit with Product). There was one last hurdle before getting an offer, and that was one last behavioural/culture fit interview with the CPO. Unfortunately that interview did not go well for me. My answers were vague and I did not show how well my skills are aligned with the company.

First let's go on a bit of a tangent and talk about interview preparation and the mistake I made during the preparation for this one.

## The importance of good preparation for me

I am very insecure in interviews. I once failed the simplest code pairing interview because I had a blank on how JavaScript arrays works. Those same arrays I use on a daily basis... That is when I decided this can't happen anymore and set up a process to prepare for interview.

Here is a summary of my preparation process. I will add a link here later, as this topic deserves it's own post.

The thing that worked for me for the first 7 interviews is good preparation. First and foremost, try to get as much information as possible from the talent acquisition person you are talking. Most often than not they want you to succeed and will help you prepare well. Once you have that information prepare, prepare, prepare. I have tones of questions and answer to those questions somewhere in my drive. Have examples ready for those situations. And the night before an interview, I actually go to bed early. It does help cement what I just reviewed and gives me that confidence. The last thing I do is flex my (hidden) muscles, Cristiano Ronaldo style, in a winner pose a few minutes before the interview (even better if there is a mirror in front of me). Taking that stress in and make it positive stress.

My mistake here was to accept the last interview, with the CPO, on the same day. Got a call Monday morning and the interview was set up on the Monday evening. That gave me no time for my preparation process. And that showed during the interview, I was not as confident as I was in the previous interviews and not-knowing-how-javascript-arrays-work me was back for the most important interview of the process.

They were kind enough to give me the feedback that I did not demonstrate the ability to build a high-performing culture. It was indeed a question I was asked and my answer was, I later realised, totally off. I described a team I have been part of as an individual contributor rather than describing how I foster high-performing teams. Given this feedback, I needed to articulate better my approach of fostering a high-performance team!

I decided that I'd share my insights on how I would build a high-performing environment, based on both my recent experiences and past successes.

## How do I build a high-performing team?

First of all, I am pretty sure that if you ask 20 people this question you'll get 20 different answers. Here is my personal take on this. I'll start with discussing the right environment for a high performing-team.  

### Setting up the right environment

Set up individual and team objectives and key results (OKRs)
Give the team enough time and space to focus on goals.

#### Goals

An important part of a high-performing culture is goals. Each individual, each team, each department and the company itself should have goals. On the company level this usually derives from a north star. An example of north star is "impact 1 million lives a day". In this case, an example of goal could be "impact 1 life a day" on the day the company start. That goal trickles all the way down to the team and the individual. I quite like the Objectives and Key Results framework to set those goals up and track their results. I won't go into all the details about OKRs here, but I recommend the book [Radical Focus](https://www.amazon.com.au/Radical-Focus-Achieving-Important-Objectives/dp/0996006052) if you want to learn more about OKRs. Alternatively you might find a link to an article on OKRs here at some point! (Am I over ambitious with the many future links?)

One of the reason I like this framework is that it ties in with fostering collaboration and accountability. The objectives and key results are visible to everyone, this tends to make people more accountable. The visibility also promotes collaboration as everyone knows what the higher goals are, as well as what each other individual goals are. This usually spawns spontaneous help from peers with knowledge to achieve a goal.

With those goals and plans in place to achieve them, you can now also demand excellence from your team members.

##### Leader contribution to goals

As a team leader, you work with the team to setup team goals and plans.
As a people leader, you work with each individuals to setup their own goals and plans. I use something like the Goal, Reality, Options, Way forward ([GROW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROW_model)) model for individual coaching.

#### Responsibility and accountability

With goals now in place, everyone in the team shares the responsibility to achieve those goals. As a leader, I am the person accountable for the achievement, or not, of this goals. Each individual is accountable for the achievement of their personal goals. Accountability is often seen negatively, an enabler for the blame game. I see it differently, it's fuel for my motivation to achieve a goal!

A team will always be responsible for the work they do. A high-performing team is one where each member takes accountability for what they do. This often translate with taking ownership of the project and part of the project.

I'll try to portray an accountable person and her opposite. First a bit of context. A pull request has been raised, on a part of the code that is usually not touched all that much:

* Vera opens the PR, skims through in 2 minutes, gives a green tick and a LGTM!
* Patricia on the other hand looks at the PR thoroughly, tries to understand the code, asks questions where she cannot understand. Also checks if there are any edge cases mixed.

Patricia shows accountability here. Side note, this is just an example and in real life, Jon, who raised the PR, takes the team through the PR before they individually review.

##### Leader contribution to accountability and responsibility

Have high expectations and demand excellence from your team members. The high expectations must be well placed though, for example, you cannot expect from a junior developer that they are as efficient and fast as a senior. They might, but you can't expect it.

When accountability is missing, one thing that the leader can do is give ownership of parts of the project to team members. Start small.

Giving more responsibilities can also be achieved with delegating tasks to your team members. They will be responsible for those task, the accountability will most likely remain on the leader.

#### Communication and Collaboration

Let me start with what is not a high-performing culture. A culture of us vs them. A culture of engineering vs product vs sales vs marketing. A culture where your voice is not heard. A culture where the most senior people don't acknowledge or consider feedback. This is a toxic culture.

A high-performing culture is one where everyone shoots in the same direction, working hands in hands to achieve the company objectives! It's all of us vs the goal.

Earlier I touched on feedback. A high-performing culture is a culture that has feedback at its center. Next are the characteristics of good feedback.

Good feedback is given timely, the closer to what prompted the feedback as possible. And no, 6 months later during the yearly review is definitely not the moment for feedback. There should be no surprises to everyone during a yearly review.
Good feedback is specific, points to a particular behaviour, is articulated clearly and is supported by examples.
Good feedback is sincere, it shows that you care deeply about the person you give the feedback to. [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) by Kim Scott explains that better than I ever will.

On praise and criticism, the rule is praise publicly and criticise privately. I agree with the latter, but prefer to leave the first one to everyone's choice. I usually ask my team member in our first ever one-on-one how they prefer receiving praise, in private or in public. Regardless of their answer they'll be included in shoutouts for the whole team!

Genuine feedback instigates trust between team members. When trust levels are high, collaboration is fruitful.

As a leader, take into account all opinions and solutions from junior to senior members. Acknowledge and document them. Explain your reasoning for dismissing a solution and document this as well. What's important is that everyone feels heard.

To thrive a team needs a psychologically safe environment. No good work happens when no feedback is given or when solutions are not proposed because they'd be shut down. Building such an environment can be challenging. My advice here is to do some team bonding. Get everyone to know a bit more about each other.

Good collaboration happens when there is good communication. At some point I recall saying:

> "Private messages are the bane of my existence" - Jonathan Noé

Information and decisions are better shared in public rather than kept in private messages. That was a time where I set my status as "I won't respond to PMs. If you have a question to ask about the project ask in a relevant channel". That was actually bad communication on my end because I offended both Product Managers and Project Managers, when the only thing I wanted to offend was Private Messages. Communicating about the project in private chats is better than no communication, but it can have a bad effect on your culture. Information is siloed, other team members can feel alienated. There is also the chance of missing out on someone else's knowledge. By reaching out to a group you increase your chances to get to a solution quicker. With a caveat on the size of the group, too many cooks won't make a better dish.

#### Learning

Encourage your team members to constantly learn, keep up-to-date and improve. Encourage them to use their learning credits, to take some time during work hours to focus on personal development. Create forums to foster knowledge sharing, such as guild meetings, tech channels or book/courses/videos database in your documentation tool. Lead by example and share articles you read (is this the moment I tell you subscribe, hit the bell, leave a comment and share?).

Invite your team to attend relevant conferences. Just be careful not to turn your culture to Conference Driven Development.

#### Innovation

Leave some wiggle room for innovation. Innovation is important in a high-performance culture as it fosters collaboration and promotes ownership for those innovations. My personal experience with Hackathons has been average. What really worked well for my teams in the past few years were innovation sprints. A full 2 weeks where the team collaborates on creating software or processes to improve the day to day. Be careful not to make that just another sprint, by forcing what is innovated on. Let them work on projects they proposed or are interested in.

#### Celebration

I don't have much to say on this one! Make sure you celebrate wins! You won an important tender, or released an important feature, it's time for a celebration! Celebrate the teams that participated in this win! Give them a shout out! Nominate them for whatever your company has in place for celebration, bonuses, cash awards or the likes! Spent many months on something tangible? Celebrate by giving the team an innovation sprint! Or a party! Or both?

Sometimes people with a sense of ownership will go above and beyond to meet an important deadline. Acknowledge this and make sure that they are taking some time in lieu or wellbeing leaves to make sure their batteries recharge. I am not sure this belongs in celebrating, as I would not want you to think that overtime should be celebrated! So no, overtime should never be celebrated.

Celebrating wins touches on many things that were mentioned earlier. It boosts morale and motivation, strengthens team bonding, makes team members feel valued and their hard work is acknowledged, which all in all fosters a positive work environment.

### Hiring

My first piece of advice here is to not hire someone solely on their technical skills. An average engineer will be able to switch between technologies and languages fairly easily. Prefer looking for someone that fits the culture.
During the culture fit/behavioural interview ask questions to see if a person is responsible. Ask how they work in a team. Ask how they handle mistakes. You'll get a feel if that person is a match for your culture.
There are also questions to ask if the person is accountable. Ask them to describe a project they worked on that they are proud of. You'll get a sense if they took ownership of the project.
This one hurts just a tiny bit: hiring the right person where the values align with the culture is the starting point to keep a high performing culture going on. A good example is what spawned this post. They were right not to move further with me, as I have not demonstrated that I fit their culture well.

Before the hiring process starts, identify what is missing in your team. If your team full of senior people who value mentoring, hire someone more junior. If you have a team of mid-level engineers who need guidance, hire someone senior who is good mentor. If you have someone that goes by the book and always seeks the gold plated solution, hire someone who is more agile.

### Onboarding

How well you onboard someone in your company or team sets them up for success:

* David starts a new job at his new company. He does not get a laptop for 2 days. His first meeting with is manager is on his third day.
* Ken starts a new job at his new company. He received his laptop the week before. His first day is meeting with all the relevant people, P&C, his manager, IT. His machine his setup by the end of the day. He is expected to raise a PR on his next day.

Who do you think will most likely gain confidence and start on the right foot and be able to perform well?

Some tips:

* Have an onboarding page that is updated often.
* Ask new starters to improve the page.
* Organise a welcome lunch on their first or second day.
* Invite them to all relevant meetings.

### Monitoring

When the team productivity takes a nose dive, try to identify what is going on early. The earlier you take remedial actions, the better it will be.

Be aware of the strength and weaknesses of your team members. Some are good at debugging, some are good at investigating, some are good at just creating something new. Some dig into rabbit holes (I'll take you to my burrow some day), some need breathers, some need new challenges.

When a someone leaves or someone joins an existing team, that team actually ceases to exist. You now have a brand new team on your hands. That new team is not guaranteed to be as high performing from the start.

### Letting go

That is the not so fun part about being in a managerial position. If someone in your team is under-performing or does not fit the culture anymore, the best thing for both party is to severe the tie. During my first experience as a leader, we hired a developer who was not up to the standards. I was being nice to him, and for a month I just sat with him every day to pair with him. That stopped me from doing what I was supposed to do. My CEO asked if we should get rid of him. Said no... A few weeks later she made the decision and just got rid of the person. And that was the biggest relief for me. And taught me a valuable lesson.

In a similar way, your team is only as good as how well they work together. An employee, however brilliant they are, who is not a team player, or who does not take feedback in from you or from the team is detrimental to both the team and the company.

Sometimes someone who blended in with the culture well suddenly stops being aligned. That most likely happens because of a change in the culture. A culture is a moving piece, it will change as the company changes, as it scales, as it's management changes, as it faces hardship. Some people adapt and some don't and as a result are no longer aligned with the team. Relationships can turn sour and here, again, it is better to part ways. You are doing the team and the person a favour.

This ended up much longer than what I expected. This will serve me as guide for future interviews until I come up with the V2 of this document.

That's all folks.
