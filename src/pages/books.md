## ⚠️ This page is under construction ⚠️

And should always be, this is a reminder for me to read

## Pre-amble

Here is a list of books that I enjoyed reading. This will evolve as time passes. When links are added to the books I'll add two links, one with and one without affiliation as follows:

* Book name link (affiliate book name link)

## Personal development

* Kim Scott - Radical Candor
* Camiller Fournier - The Manager's path
* Lara Hogan - Resilient Management
* Michael Bungay Stanier - The Coaching habit
* Julie Zhuo - The Making of a manager
* Chris Voss - Never split the difference
* Daniel H. Pink - Drive

The following are books for parents. But while reading some of them, I thought that lots of it could apply for leaders

* Daniel J. Siegel, MD and Tina Payne Bryson, PhD - The whole-brain child
* Steve Biddulph - Raising Boys/Raising Girls in the twenty-first century
* Phillippa Perry - The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read
* Brain Rules for Baby - John Medina  

## Personal Development Fiction

* Gene Kim, George Spafford and Kevin Behr - The Phoenix Project (this could have equally gone in Personal Development)
* Christina Wodke - Radical Focus

## Fiction

I have to say I have not been reading lots of fiction recently.

* All things Harry Potter
* All things J.R.R Tolkien
* All things René Barjavel

## Kid books recommendation

For young kids:

* Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see?
* Ten little fingers and ten little toes
